###Graph QL

Any time the front-end makes a request to the back end, check if there is an existing GraphQL query

GraphQL Frontend Integration: Always ensure frontend GraphQL mutations match the backend schema structure. The backend expects input objects (e.g., LoginINput) rather than individual parameters

Any time you start building new GraphQL endpoints or mutations, you MUST reference similar endpoints to understand the patterns that currently work for the app.

### Supabase

Any time you want to make edits, modifications, and updates within supabase use the supabase mcp server

### App Language
The frontend (what the user can see) should be written in spanish.

###Linear MCP

Since the features documentation will be in the future passed on to a front end and back end engineer, everytime I ask you to send something to the backlog using the linear MCP, I want you to remove any lines related to the feature sent to the backlog from the read me files and markdown files within the features directory to avoid confusion.
