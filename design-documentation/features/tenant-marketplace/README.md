# Tenant Marketplace Feature

## Overview

The Tenant Marketplace is a reverse marketplace feature that allows tenants who cannot find suitable properties to publish their requirements, enabling landlords to discover and contact qualified tenants directly. This innovative approach solves the discovery problem when inventory doesn't match demand.

## Feature Objectives

### Primary Goals
- Enable tenants to broadcast their housing needs to all landlords
- Create a qualified lead pool for landlords to browse
- Reduce search frustration when suitable properties aren't listed
- Facilitate proactive landlord outreach to potential tenants

### Success Metrics
- **Post Creation Rate**: >20% of users without matches create posts
- **Landlord Engagement**: >30% of posts receive landlord responses
- **Response Quality**: >60% of responses match tenant criteria
- **Post-to-Lease Conversion**: >10% of posts result in signed leases
- **Average Response Time**: <24 hours for first landlord contact

## Key User Stories

### Tenant Perspective
"As a tenant who can't find suitable properties, I want to publish my requirements, so that landlords can contact me directly with matching properties."

### Landlord Perspective
"As a landlord with upcoming vacancies, I want to browse tenant requirements, so that I can proactively reach out to qualified prospects."

### Platform Perspective
"As the platform, I want to facilitate reverse discovery, so that we can create matches even when perfect inventory isn't listed."

## Design Principles

### Structured Flexibility
- Guided post creation with smart defaults
- Flexible requirement expression
